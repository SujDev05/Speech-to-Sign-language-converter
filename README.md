# Speech-to-Sign Language Converter

This project uses deep learning to convert spoken audio into real-time sign language animations. It utilizes automatic speech recognition (ASR) to transcribe speech into text and a Text-to-Sign Language Mapping Model to generate sign language gestures. 

## Features
- Converts speech into text using ASR.
- Translates text into dynamic sign language gestures.
- Provides real-time sign language animation for communication.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git (for version control)
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SujDev05/Speech-to-Sign-language-converter.git
cd Speech-to-Sign-language-converter
```
Step 2: Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
If you want to create a virtual environment, follow these steps:


# Install virtualenv if you don't have it
```bash
pip install virtualenv
```
```bash
# Create a virtual environment
virtualenv venv
```
```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
```

Step 3: Install Dependencies
Once you have activated the virtual environment, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Step 4: Download Pre-trained Models
If you are using pre-trained models for ASR or sign language gestures, make sure to download them and place them in the appropriate directory as specified in the code. Example:

Download the speech-to-text model and sign language model files and store them under the models/ directory.

Step 5: Run the Project
Start the Application: After installing dependencies and placing models in the right directory, you can run the main script to start the application.

```bash
python app.py  # or the appropriate file to start the server
```

Access the Application: Once the server is running, you should be able to access it locally, or if set up for remote use, at the given URL.

Step 6: Test the Speech-to-Sign Conversion
To test the speech-to-sign language conversion:

Use the audio file input or microphone input to capture speech.

The system will convert the speech into text and map it to corresponding sign language gestures.

Step 7: Customize and Extend
Feel free to modify the existing code to add more gestures or extend the speech-to-text functionality as needed. You can train your own models if required, or use existing models from Hugging Face, TensorFlow, or other sources.

Troubleshooting
1. Missing Libraries
If you encounter missing library errors, ensure that you have installed the required dependencies via pip install -r requirements.txt.

2. GPU Issues
If you're using TensorFlow or PyTorch on a GPU and encounter issues, make sure you have installed the correct versions of tensorflow-gpu and torch.
