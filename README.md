# 🧠 Speech-to-Sign Language Translator 🤟

A deep learning-powered pipeline that translates **spoken language into sign language gestures** using audio, pretrained models, and gesture mapping. Built for inclusivity, accessibility, and a pinch of AI wizardry.


⚙️ Installation
Requires Python 3.8+

1. Clone the repo
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
# For Linux/macOS
python -m venv sign_env
source sign_env/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv sign_env
sign_env\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install Python dependencies
If you don't have a requirements.txt, create one from the project:

```bash
#install common packages manually by creating requirements.txt file:
requirements.txt:
tensorflow>=2.11.0
torch>=1.13.0
numpy>=1.23.0
librosa>=0.10.0
opencv-python>=4.7.0
scikit-learn>=1.2.0
matplotlib>=3.6.0
sounddevice>=0.4.6
speechrecognition>=3.10.0
pyaudio>=0.2.13
flask>=2.2.2
flask-cors>=3.0.10
nltk>=3.8.1
transformers>=4.25.1
joblib>=1.2.0
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow flask
```

 *Running the Project:*
 To run the full pipeline from audio to sign gesture video:
```bash
python main.py
```

To run the web app (if using Flask/FastAPI):
```bash
python app.py
```
This will start a local server (likely on http://127.0.0.1:5000/) where you can upload audio and view gesture translation.

*Models Used:*
speech_to_sign_model.h5: Converts speech features to gesture class probabilities.

sign_language_model.h5: Generates sign gesture sequences (video or frames).

gesture_mapping.json: Decodes model output into meaningful sign labels.

*Sample Input*
real-time live audio

Output saved as: output.mp4

 *Contribution*
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork, make a PR, or open issues.
